<h1>hello my name is justin escamilla </h1>
<h2>i am in the tenth grade</h2>
<p>one thing i would say i love is my karate career it has helped me in so many ways and i learned that mixed martial arts isnt only to learn how to defend yourself but it teaches disipline and it also teaches you how to be a better you.</p>
  <p>typically what i hate is how stupid this world is, we dont have to hate eachother over some dumb things. especially presidents i think everything about this world is stupid, were destroying our planet. this big ball of rock is the only thing keeeping us alive and people dont realize it but sooner or later tere would be no earth to live in and we wouold make it much more complicated for our future to find a place to live. think about that.</p>
